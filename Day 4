// Magical Number 
/*Your friend loves magic and he has coined a new term - "Magical number". To perform his magic, he needs that magic number. You are given a sorted array arr of distinct integers. A number arr[i] is a magical number if arr[i] = i (0-based indexing).
You have to return the leftmost magical number present in the given array arr, if there is no magical number in the array arr then return -1

Example1:

Input:
N = 5
arr = {-2, -1, 2, 4, 6}
Output: 2
Explanation: there is only one magical number present at index 2 because arr[2] = 2.*/

code:
class Solution {
  public:
    int findMagicalNumber(int N, vector<int> &arr) {
        for(int i =0;i<N;i++){
         if(arr[i]==i){
             return i;
         }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
